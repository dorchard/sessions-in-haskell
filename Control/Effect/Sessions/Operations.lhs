This file defines effectful operations which encode the core operations
of the (session type) pi-calculus.

The simplest operations, send and receive of primitive values,
take a named channel 'Chan c' and return a 'Process' computation
indexed by the session environment '[c :-> S]' where 'S' is either a
send or receive action (terminated by 'End').

> {-| Send a primitive-typed value -}
> send :: Chan c -> t -> Process '[c :-> t :! End] ()
> send (MkChan c) t = Process $ C.writeChan (unsafeCoerce c) t

> {-| Receive a primitive-typed value -}
> recv :: Chan c -> Process '[c :-> t :? End] t
> recv (MkChan c) = Process $ C.readChan (unsafeCoerce c) -- >>= (return . unWrap)

The 'new' combinator models $\nu$,  which takes
a function mapping from a pair of two channels names
'Ch c' and 'Op C' to a session with behaviour 's', and creates
a session where any mention to 'Ch c' or 'Op c' is removed:

> {-| Create a new channel and pass its two endpoints to the supplied continuation
>      (the first parameter). This channel is thus only in scope for this continuation -}
> new :: (Duality env c)
>           =>  ((Chan (Ch c), Chan (Op c)) -> Process env t)
>           ->  Process (env :\ (Op c) :\ (Ch c)) t
> new f = Process $ C.newChan >>= (\c -> getProcess $ f (MkChan c, MkChan c))

> {-| Parallel compose two processes, if they contain balanced sessions -}
> par :: (BalancedPar env env') =>
>         Process env () -> Process env' () -> Process (DisjointUnion env env') ()
> par (Process x) (Process y) =  Process $ do res <- newEmptyTMVarIO
>                                             res' <- newEmptyTMVarIO
>                                             Conc.forkIO $ (x >>= (atomically . (putTMVar res)))
>                                             Conc.forkIO $ (y >>= (atomically . (putTMVar res')))
>                                             () <- atomically $ do { takeTMVar res }
>                                             () <- atomically $ do { takeTMVar res' }
>                                             return ()

> {-| Turn all session types into 'balancing checked' session types |-}

> rsend :: Chan c -> Chan d -> Process '[c :-> (Delg s) :*! End, d :-> Bal s] ()
> rsend (MkChan c) t = Process $ C.writeChan (unsafeCoerce c) t

Channels can then be sent and received with the 'chSend' and 'chRecv' primitives:

> {-| Send a channel 'd' over channel 'c' -}
> chSend :: Chan c -> Chan d -> Process '[c :-> (Delg s) :! End, d :-> Bal s] ()
> chSend (MkChan c) t = Process $ C.writeChan (unsafeCoerce c) t

> {-| Receive a channel over a channel 'c', bind to the name 'd' -}

 chRecv :: Chan c -> (Chan d -> Process env a) ->
            Process (UnionSeq '[c :-> (Delg (env :@ d)) :? (env :@ c)] (env :\ d)) a
 chRecv (MkChan c) f = Process $ C.readChan (unsafeCoerce c) >>=
                                     (getProcess . f . unsafeCoerce)

> chRecv :: Chan c -> Process '[c :-> (Delg (env :@ d)) :? End]
>                         ((Chan d -> Process env a) -> Process (env :\ d) a)
> chRecv (MkChan c) = Process $ return $
>                                \f -> let y = (C.readChan (unsafeCoerce c) >>=
>                                                      (getProcess . f . unsafeCoerce))
>                                      in Process $ y


Given a channel 'c', and a computation which binds channel 'd' to produces behaviour
'c', then this is provided by receiving 'd' over 'c'. Thus the resulting computation
is the union of 'c' mapping to the session type of 'd' in the session environment
's', composed with the 's' but with 'd' deleted (removed).

Subeffecting instances for the least-upper bound :+ operator and for extending
an environment with a closed session channel, i.e. with c :-> End.
