<h1>Artifact for <i>Effects as sessions, sessions as effects</i> (<a href="sessions/popl16preprint.pdf">preprint PDF</a>)</h1>
<h3>Dominic Orchard, Nobuko Yoshida (Imperial College London)</h3>

<p>
Effect and session type systems are two expressive behavioural type
systems. The former is usually developed in the context of the
lambda-calculus and its variants, the latter for the pi-calculus.  In
our paper we explored their relative expressive power.  Firstly, we
gave an embedding from PCF, augmented with a parameterised effect
system, into a session-typed pi-calculus (session calculus), showing
that session types are powerful enough to express effects.  Secondly,
we gave a reverse embedding, from the session calculus back into PCF,
by instantiating PCF with concurrency primitives and its effect system
with a session-like effect algebra (Section 6).  The embedding of session types
into an effect system is leveraged to give an implementation of
session types in Haskell, via an effect system encoding (Section
7). <b>This is the artifact of this paper</b>, provided as the
<i>effect-sessions</i> library.</p>

<p>
Section 6 and 7
are the relevant parts of the paper for the artifact. As explained in
Section 7, the implementation is not explicitly designed to be a
user-friendly interface for programming with sessions. Instead, it is
a fairly direct rendering in Haskell of the encoding of Section 6.
Its aim is to give credance to embedding of Section 6 and to
provide a new basis for working with session types in
Haskell-- but is not a full "end product" in terms of user programming.
</p>

<p>
<b>Limitations</b>. There are a number of limitations in the implementation
due to the limits of Haskell compared with the variant of PCF in Section 6.
Mainly, Haskell has no subtyping or equirecursive types. The former is solved
via explicit subtyping combinators in Haskell. The latter (equirecursive types)
is solved via restricted forms of recursion, with fixed-points computed at the
type-level only for affine effect equations. In practice, this covers a multitude
of examples.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ul>

<li>Ensure you have GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) of at least version <b>7.8.1</b>.
   <blockquote class="info">
  The latest version of GHC (7.10.2) 
  can be downloaded as part of the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a>
   for Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X.<br /><br />
  To upgrade an existing Haskell Platform for Linux, there are good instructions <a href="https://www.haskell.org/downloads/linux">here</a> (tested for Ubuntu). 
</blockquote>
  </li>

<li>Install the <i>stm</i> package:

  <blockquote class="prompt">
  <pre>
   cabal install stm</pre>
  </blockquote>
</li>

<li><a href="sessions/source.zip">Download and unzip the library sources</a>
  <blockquote class="info">
  The library also relies on the <i>effect-monad</i> and <i>type-level-sets</i> libraries.
     The relevant files from these are included with the download here for ease of use.
The files comprising the contribution of the artifact are:
   <blockquote class="prompt">
   <pre>
   Control/Effect/Sessions.hs
   Control/Effect/Sessions/Process.lhs
   Control/Effect/Sessions/Operations.lhs
   Data/Type/FiniteMap.lhs
   examples.lhs
   effect-sessions.cabal</pre>
   </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  </li>

<li>The <tt>examples.lhs</tt> file in the top-level directory
  provides a tutorial-like set of examples showing how to use
the library. Open this in GHC interactive mode via:

<blockquote class='prompt'>
<pre>
$ ghci examples.lhs
...
Main*></pre>
</blockquote>
Then you are ready to try examples (by using <tt>run</tt>) and examine the types (e.g., executing
  <tt>:t simpleServer</tt>). Please follow the material in <tt>examples.lhs</tt>, which is a Literate Haskell file.
  This complements and expands on Section 7 of the paper. 
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<ul><li>The library has full Haddock <a href="sessions/doc/html/effect-sessions/index.html">documentation here</a>.
  Most useful is the documentation for <a href="sessions/doc/html/effect-sessions/Control-Effect-Sessions-Operations.html">Control.Effect.Sessions.Operations</a> which explains
  each combinator provided by the library for concurrency.</li>
  <li>The main <tt>examples.lhs</tt> provides tutorial.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
  If experiencing problems running the <tt>examples.lhs</tt>, try running <tt>cabal configure</tt> in
  the top-level directory which should explain more clearly any missing dependencies in your Haskell
  setup.<br /><br />
  
  Whilst experimenting the library, the programmer may encounter some harder to read errors.
  This is a shortcoming of GHC type-level programming: it is hard to get good domain-specific errors.
  The following provides some hints.<br />
  <ul><li>A common cause of errors is not naming channels. Channels should be named whenever there is more than
    one channel being used in a computation block. If two endpoints of a channel are being bound
    in <tt>new</tt> then only one needs to be named. </li>
    <li>Occasionally, extra type annotations are needed on primitive types to restrict them from polymorphic
    to monomorphic instances. e.g., write <tt>(x :: Int) <- recv c</tt> instead of just <tt>x <- recv c</tt>.</li>
    <li>Check that the error isn't an expected error: e.g., the types of the process don't match up, or
    a balancing check fails, e.g. <tt>NotBal (Bal s)</tt>.
    </li>

    </ul>
  
<h2>Notes</h2>
  
   <ul>
    <li><i>effect-sessions</i> has been tested on the following architectures/versions:
      <ul><li>Mac OS X 10.9.5: GHC 7.8.2 and GHC 7.10.1</li>
	  <li>Windows 7, GHC 7.10.2</li>
	  <li>Ubuntu 15.04, GHC 7.10.2</li>
       </ul>

     <li><i>effect-sessions</i> relies on the <i>effect-monad</i> and <i>type-level-sets</i> libraries.
     These are included with the download here for ease of use. These can also be installed via
     cabal (<tt>cabal install effect-monad</tt>, <tt>cabal install type-level-sets</tt>).</li></ul>

    <ul><li><i>effect-sessions</i> itself can be installed
      (though this isn't necessary for experimenting with the examples) via:
 <blockquote class='prompt'>
 <pre>
 cabal configure
 cabal build
 cabal install
 </pre>
      </blockquote>
      Depending on your setup, the last command 'cabal install' may require super-user privileges.
      </li>
    </ul>
